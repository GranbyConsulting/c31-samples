This folder contains a sample that uses a couple of custom
webpages to display tags as tiles or bars. The values are
updated using AJAX. The database should be loaded into
your target device, and the htm and css files placed in the
WEB directory on the memory card. The FTP batch file can be
used to do this automatically, which is nice when you're
debugging the source code. Note that the database network
configuration may need to be changed!
