This folder contains a sample that uses a custom webpage
to display dynamically updating tag values. The values are
initially displayed using the embedded value syntax, and
then updated using AJAX. The database should beloaded into
your target device, and the default.htm file placed in the
WEB directory on the memory card. The FTP batch file can be
used to do this automatically, which is nice when you're
debugging the source code. Note that the database network
configuration may need to be changed!
