
This folder contains a sample that uses a custom webpage
to write tag values from a form. The database should be
loaded into your target device, and the default.htm file
placed in the WEB directory on the memory card. The FTP
batch file can be used to do this automatically, which is
nice when you're debugging the source code. Note that the
database network configuration may need to be changed!
