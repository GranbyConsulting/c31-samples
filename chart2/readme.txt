This folder contains a sample that uses a custom webpage
to display dynamically updating tag values via both a table
and one of several chart formats support by Chart.js. The
values are updated using AJAX. The database should beloaded
into your target device, and the htm and js files placed in
the WEB directory on the memory card. The FTP batch file can
be used to do this automatically, which is nice when you're
debugging the source code. Note that the database network
configuration may need to be changed!
